### Website Purpose
The purpose of this website is to create a portfolio to represent my web development skills. The portfolio site will be shown to everyone I can get it in front of to help secure a job in the software development industry. It will help separate me from others by demonstrating some of my design skills as well as my professional personality.
### Website Design
This website will have a modern feel to it in a minimilistic style. My Vision is if Medium.com met Tesla and the wonderful colours of purple. Why the colour purple? Well simple, purple is awesome and when I look at pictures of the galaxy it's the colour that makes space awesome for me. I believe that space is the future for us and will be possible with tech and the integral part code has to play to get us there. I created the feel for space with a simple Black white and gradient purple colour scheme and sleek minimalistic font choices.

### Personal Note
I had a heap of fun working on this project. It is the first time that I have made a finished product, and won't be the last. This is my "Hello World" in the beginning of my developer journey. I have already started to think of all the things I can add to this portfolio as my skills in other languages improve. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and look at my portfolio site.
